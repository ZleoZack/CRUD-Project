Here we have created a wonderful WebPage design that allows for a Blogger to make posts of their favorite recipes!

We wanted to streamline the ability to utilize this great catalogging software we built out of REACT and Javascript!

The features include creating and adding a new recipe/ a delete button that allows for deletions to be made. Also we have made great use of HTML Forms,
and REACT to access state and allow for a great customized user interface!

Future Goals: To implement advertising balloons, provide a better CSS experience. And perhaps allow for recipes to show up on the webpage that a specific catalogger
might be interested in, utilizing BOOTSTRAP cards and algorithyms.
